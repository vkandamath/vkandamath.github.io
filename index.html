                        <h3>Full-Stack</h3>
                        <p>I have hands-on experience with multiple layers on the stack, including UX, backend processing, and database querying. I prefer to work on the backend side of things, especially when it comes to web and mobile apps. Although my specialty lies in backend languages such as Python and Java, I enjoy wearing multiple hats and playing around with frontend technologies such as CSS and jQuery.

                        <p>I also enjoy working with projects that process and transform large sets of data. I have learned machine-learning techniques in my data science class and have worked with Bioinformatics projects. I also worked with database querying and data transformations at my previous Accenture internship.</p>

                        <p>There is a large discrepancy between university-level projects and industry-level production code. Therefore, I spend a lot of my free time learning new technologies such as Node.js, Socket.io, and Javascript. I increased my front-end knowhow while building this site, for example!</div>
