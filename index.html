                        <p>
                            When I code, you'll probably find me sipping on bubble tea and listening to Rap. I've been programming since I was in high school, building a founding in Java and leveraging that to learn new programming languages and technologies such as Node.js, Socket.io, Python, etc. <br><br>

                            I graduated from the University of Maryland (Go terps!) on a full-merit scholarship with a major in Computer Science and minor in Innovation and Entreprenuership. During my time at UMD, I was part of the Advanced Cybersecurity Experience for Students (ACES) honors program, where I studied cybersecurity through technical, political, and ethical lenses.<br><br>

                            During my time at UMD, I took technical courses including Data Science, Bioinformatics, Database Design, and Computer Networks, more of which can be found in my resume.<br><br>

                            <p class="description">I have hands-on experience with multiple layers on the stack, including UX, backend processing, and database querying. I prefer to work on the backend side of things, especially when it comes to web and mobile apps. Although my specialty lies in backend languages such as Python and Java, I enjoy wearing multiple hats and playing around with frontend technologies such as CSS and jQuery.

                            <p class="description">I also enjoy working with projects that process and transform large sets of data. I have learned machine-learning techniques in my data science class and have worked with Bioinformatics projects. I also worked with database querying and data transformations at my previous Accenture internship.</p><br><br>

                            <p class="description">There is a large discrepancy between university-level projects and industry-level production code. Therefore, I spend a lot of my free time learning new technologies such as Node.js, Socket.io, and Javascript. I increased my front-end knowhow while building this site, for example!</div>

                            <p>An Android app using the Spotify SDK and Myo SDK. We wanted to be able to have our music adapt to the way we worked out. As a runner picks up the pace during a cardio workout, the music would get more intense. As the runner cools down at the end of the workout, the music would adapt and decrease in intensity. The app would randomly select songs from different Spotify playlists that are classified as low-intensity, medium-intensity, and high-intensity. Future improvements could involve allowing user to create their own playlists for each category of music intensity. Improvements could also allow app to learn from itself and adapt its motion tracking to change its music based on an individual's style of running.</p>
